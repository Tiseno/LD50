# Ludum Dare 50: Delay the inevitable

Using my own entity component system (ecs) entities are mutated with adding and removing components randomly during runtime.
I had a technical detail first approach, and such, inevitably, I did not finish anything playable more than the mutating entities, a moving player entity, and shooting of some exploding projectile entities :)
